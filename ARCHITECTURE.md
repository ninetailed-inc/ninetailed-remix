# Architecture

## Purpose

Public Remix application demonstrating a Ninetailed integration.

## Main areas

- app/ contains routes and application code.
- public/ contains static assets.
- vite.config.ts configures the Remix Vite build.
- package.json defines development, build, lint, typecheck, and start commands.

## Change flow

Repository manifests and checked-in configuration define how source becomes a build, package, report, example, or documentation artifact. Keep changes inside the owning area and follow explicit dependencies rather than copying behavior between components.

## Boundaries

External services, credentials, and deployment environments are not represented by source code alone. Local validation should use documented fixtures or configuration and must not embed secrets.

## Failure and verification

Start with the narrowest affected command, inspect its direct inputs, and expand to repository-level validation. If a required external system is unavailable, record that verification gap instead of claiming success.
